challenges faced - still dont have the required knowledge about nlp modeling so am unabel to perform full functioning as mentioned 


explaination of approach:- converting the pdf file into the text file using pypdf2 and then using some regular expressions by importing re 
for name ,email, phone number 

also ,using keyword matching for getting the skills 
in keyword matching i created a list in which i added up some of tech skills that  are very well known now a days and just parsing the text 
if the keyword gets matched it will get added up into the list

and creating a formated string summary 
and at last creating a text file by the user name as per resume and adding it in write byte mode and adding the summary into it 



also ,have tested this program for 4-5 different formate
